# 2017 Spring Programming Languages

This repository contians assignments for LMU CMSI 386: Programming Languages.

These projects were done in collaboration between [Ben Davis](https://github.com/bdavs3) and [Brian Joerger](https://github.com/bjoerger7).

**Update June 21, 2019** â€“ I ([Ben](https://github.com/bdavs3)) am going back and organizing some things on Github. These were some cool projects, so I want to keep them around. Dr. Toal's [website](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/pl/) for the class still has the assignment descriptions up. They may have changed here and there, but for the most part, they still describe some of the things that we did in this class, so I added the proper links to each assignment folder.
